//React element
const jsxeheading = <h1 className='header' tabIndex={1}>React Assignments</h1>
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(jsxeheading);

//component composition,Functional component, a function return jsx code.
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="header">Header</h1>
      {BodyComponent()}  // these two are the same things.
      <BodyComponent />
    </div>
  );
};


jsx is so powerfull that it can avoid cross-site scripting,avoids malicious data.


props => passing properties to component, its just a argument


/*
Header - logo component, nav component
body - search, card container, cards
footer - copyrights etc.
*/




//not recommended to use index as a key in map.



React Hooks:
react hooks are react utility functions, useState hook is used for updating the state of the variable according the logic we wrote, everytime the variable updates, react rerenders the whole application
